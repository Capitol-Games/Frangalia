# Frangalia

## Description

At the beginning of time, so it is told by the tablet of Vesinius, that the gods created time, and the four elements of earth, water, wind, and fire. It was the god Keras who conceived man, animals, monsters, and all living things, with kingship the highest in the universal order. Thus, great rulers came to be in the ancient cities in the realm of Frangalia. During this time it is said Keras lived among them as a great wizard, guiding his creations to prosperity.

The ancient rulers built splendorous kingdoms, but growing jealous, the lesser gods exiled Keras from the heavens and unleashed terror upon civilization as Zu'gol, demon of destruction, ascended to the earth from fiery pits below, sowing seeds of evil and malice. Many monsters and weaker men joined his cause, and the long night set in.

The human king Chlodwig of Galintor, under the influence and aid of Zu'gol, imprisoned and ordered the death of Keras by crucifixion. These ages grew darker as Lazarus' subjects turned to necromancy and the dark arts.

Remiel, goddess of angels and Keras' lover, aided the great king Osgard to build a church so to please the spirit of Keras to ward off the evil that roamed the land to protect his people. Remiel gifted Osgard the way of holy magic so that his people should survive, and in return asks to be favored with Keras among the gods. Upon learning this, the other gods pursued Remiel, who thereafter went into hiding, never to be seen over a thousand years.

The story of creation and of great kingdoms have passed on into myth as the petty kingdoms in the realm of Frangalia wage war amongst themselves, and with monsters who roam the vast, unsanctified ancient world, full of danger and treasure.

In the modern age, the mystic Velthur of Terracroce tells of the coming of Remiel and a renewal of faith in Keras, so that the ancient lands may be reclaimed and Zu'gol may be banished to the underground once more.

It is in these times we find our hero, Clemens, son of a peasant farming family, in the kingdom of Colchester, a relatively new kingdom, who stumbles across an ancient shrine that transmutes hidden knowledge and sacred power of Keras. It is up to Clemens whether to use his new power for good, which political alliances to make, and where to seek out his destiny in Frangalia.
