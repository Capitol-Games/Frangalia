## Game Description

At the beginning of time, so it is told by the tablet of Vesinius, the gods created the four elements of earth, water, wind, and fire. It was the greatest god Keros who conceived man, animals, monsters, and all living things, with kingship as the highest in the natural order. Thus, a great many rulers came to be in the ancient cities byway of divine right in the realm of Frangalia. During this time it is said Keros lived among them as a great wizard of the supernatural, guiding his creations to prosperity. The ancient rulers of the realm built splendorous kingdoms.

Growing jealous, the lesser gods exiled Keros from the heavens and unleashed terror upon civilization. Zu'gol, the demon of destruction, ascended to the earth from the fiery pits below, sowing seeds of evil and malice. Many monsters and weaker men joined his cause. The everlasting daylight began to fade and dark night set in for the first time.

The corrupted human king Drogon of Mondspilm, under the influence of Zu'gol, deceived and imprisoned Keros for one hundred years before ordering his death by crucifixion. These ages grew darker as Drogon's subjects turned to necromancy and the dark arts.

Remiel, goddess of angels and Keros' wife, aided Osgard, the last great king of Frangælia, to protect his people when he built a church so to please the spirit of Keros and ward away the evil that roamed the land. Remiel gifted Osgard the way of holy magic so that his people should survive, and in return she asks to be favored with Keros among the gods. Upon learning this, the other gods pursued Remiel, who thereafter went into hiding, never to be seen since.

The stories of creation and the great kingdoms have passed on into myth as the petty kingdoms in the realm of Frangalia wage war amongst themselves instead of monsters who roam the vast, unsanctified ancient world...full of danger and forgotten treasures.

In the modern age, the mystic Manetto of Terracroce tells of the coming of Remiel and a renewal of faith in Keros, so that the ancient lands may be reclaimed and Zu'gol may be banished to the underground once more. It is in these times we find our hero, René, son of a peasant farming family, in the kingdom of Colchester, a relatively new kingdom, who stumbles across an ancient shrine that transmutes the hidden knowledge and sacred power of Keros. It is up to René to use his newfound powers for good, to choose wisely among political allies in the fragmented realm, and to find out where his destiny ultimately leads.
