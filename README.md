## Game Description

At the beginning of time, so it is told by the tablet of Vesinius, the gods created the four elements of earth, water, wind, and fire. It was the god Keras who conceived man, animals, monsters, and all living things, with kingship the highest in the universal order. Thus, great rulers came to be in the ancient cities in the realm of Frangalia. During this time it is said Keras lived among them as a great wizard, guiding his creations to prosperity.

The ancient rulers built splendorous kingdoms, but growing jealous, the lesser gods exiled Keras from the heavens and unleashed terror upon civilization as Zu'gol, demon of destruction, ascended to the earth from the fiery pits below, sowing seeds of evil and malice. Many monsters and weaker men joined his cause, and the long night set in.

The corrupted human king Drogon of Mondspilm, under the influence of Zu'gol, deceived and imprisoned Keras for one hundred years before ordering his death by crucifixion. These ages grew darker as Drogon's subjects turned to necromancy and the dark arts.

Remiel, goddess of angels and Keras' lover, aided Osgard, the last great king of Frangælia, to build a church so to please the spirit of Keras to ward off the evil that roamed the land to protect his people. Remiel gifted Osgard the way of holy magic so that his people should survive, and in return asks to be favored with Keras among the gods. Upon learning this, the other gods pursued Remiel, who thereafter went into hiding, never to be seen since.

The stories of creation and the great kingdoms have passed on into myth as the petty kingdoms in the realm of Frangalia wage war amongst themselves instead of monsters who roam the vast, unsanctified ancient world, full of danger and lost treasures.

In the modern age, the mystic Manetto of Terracroce tells of the coming of Remiel and a renewal of faith in Keras, so that the ancient lands may be reclaimed and Zu'gol may be banished to the underground once more. It is in these times we find our hero, René, son of a peasant farming family, in the kingdom of Colchester, a relatively new kingdom, who stumbles across an ancient shrine that transmutes the hidden knowledge and sacred power of Keras. It is up to René to use his newfound powers for good, to choose wisely among political allies in the fragmented realm, and to find out where his destiny ultimately leads.
